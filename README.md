# 😎 Activity Tracker (Because We're Too Lazy for Chrome Tabs)

Welcome to the **Activity Tracker** – made for lazy geniuses like us who just want a window to open and *vibe*. No frameworks, no 4-hour tutorials, just pure Python + tkinter magic. Opens a GUI. Tracks your click. That's it. You're now 10% more productive than before (probably).

## 🐢 Why This Exists

I was bored. You’re bored. Let’s make life easier.  
This app does… something.  
Probably nothing.  
But it opens, and that’s 90% of productivity right there.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements (Bare Minimum Vibes)

- Python 3.7+ (if you're on Python 2, we can’t be friends)
- `tkinter` (don’t worry, it's probably already there unless you deleted it because you're *that* chaotic)

---

## 📦 How to Install (lol)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/activity-tracker.git
cd activity-tracker
python main.py
```


# 🤓 Features (term used loosely)
✅ Opens a window

✅ Has a button (wow)

✅ Tracks how often you click said button

✅ Saves count in a file like a responsible adult

✅ Actually saves your activity (bare minimum achieved)


# 💡 Fun Things You Can Do With It
Rename the app and pretend it's AI

Show it to your manager and say you're tracking KPIs

Replace the button with a cat gif

Use it as a self-esteem booster (because clicking buttons = action)

# 🧙‍♂️ Desktop Icon Like a Pro
You can give it a cool.ico file and make it look like an actual app.
Like, on your desktop. With an icon. Like those real apps.

## Steps:

Create a shortcut of your main.py or .pyw file

Change the icon to cool.ico

Put it on your desktop and feel fancy

# 🧠 Pro Tip for Lazy People (my people)
Convert it to .pyw so it doesn’t open that ugly terminal:

- bash
Copy code
rename main.py to main.pyw
Boom. Instant stealth mode. 🎩

# 🐛 Bugs?
Yes. Probably. But we don’t talk about those.

# 🧸 License
Do whatever you want. Copy it. Remix it. Sell it to a unicorn startup.
Just don’t blame me when you forget what it does.

Made with ☕ and very little motivation.

Peace out ✌️
